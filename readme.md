# Netflix No Autoplay
This is just very(!) simple CSS to tweak a little bit Netflix website (2018) to stop those annoying autoplay videos while you're browsing through.

## What does it do exactly?
-  All autoplay videos which appears on hover/mouseover are disabled
- Accordion effect is also disabled

## How to use it
Easiest way probably through extension - Stylus. ([Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en), [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/))
